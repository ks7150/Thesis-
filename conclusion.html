      <h2>About this project</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores how Indian Miniature Art can be experienced, understood, and appreciated in a global context.
        Built as part of my thesis for the Master of Science in Integrated Design & Media at NYU, it investigates how storytelling
        through Indian art, especially mythology and folklore, has evolved across time and geographies. Taking insights from interviews,
        workshops, and museum studies, this research explores how cultural narratives are preserved, altered, and interpreted outside India.
        This website acts as a digital exhibition or an educational guide, offering interactive pathways to explore the symbolism, colors,
        and themes embedded in Indian Miniature Art and how the art form evolved with time and context. The goal of this is to help bridge
        gaps in cultural literacy and facilitate meaningful engagement, especially for audiences unfamiliar with the nuances of the tradition,
        making this rich storytelling practice accessible, contextual, and culturally rooted.

    <p class="highlight">
      Indian art can be decoded through a layered lens of color symbolism, narrative themes, iconographic elements, and evolving time periods—
      each offering insight into its cultural, spiritual, and historical context.

    <section class="formula-box">
      <h3>Color + Theme + Symbol + Time Period = Cultural Narrative</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Color</strong> reveals emotion or divinity</li>
        <li><strong>Theme</strong> points to the central story (mythological tale, court life, daily rituals)</li>
        <li><strong>Symbol</strong> indicates hidden meanings</li>
        <li><strong>Time Period</strong> shapes the style and influence</li>

    <section class="question">
      <h3>Should Indian Miniature Art evolve in style and presentation to enhance its accessibility and appeal to global audiences while preserving its traditional essence</h3>
      <p>
        This project affirms that the global representation of Indian Art must evolve. It must move beyond surface-level appreciation,
        where it is often exoticized or reduced to visual ornamentation, and instead offer viewers tools to access the layered narratives
        and meanings embedded within each piece.<br><br>
        Ultimately, this site is not just a digital gallery—it is a reimagined storytelling space. It bridges cultural divides by way of
        supplying accessible entry points right into a complicated creative tradition, aligning with the thesis’s principal intention:
        while maintaining authenticity and broader, deeper, and greater inclusive engagement with Indian Miniature Art on an international level.
